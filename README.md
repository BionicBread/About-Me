- 👋 Hi, I’m @BionicBread. Like a lot of people out there, I'm on a journey from coding noob to pro.   
- 👀 I’m interested in game dev. I'm a nerd and gamer at heart, game dev has it's obvious appeal, where else is better to focus all that learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... C#, Unity and Blender. Also Python to automate stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything.
- 📫 How to reach me ... let's keep this part blank for now.
